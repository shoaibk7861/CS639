        I am Shoaib Khan from India. I did my Under Graduation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Christ University in Bangalore. I did an internship in Java (full-stack development). This is my Second semester at Pace. I have a keen interest in Java Programming Language and I know web technologies like HTML, NodeJS, CSS, and JavaScript. I am eager to join and learn the course with my classmates... \n\n

Thank you!
